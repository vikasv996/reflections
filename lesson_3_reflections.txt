When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- There are many reasons for creating a remote repository, whenever possible along with working local in our PC.
If we are using remote repository, then irrespective of wherever we are, we can access the files via any computer.
Since it is stored in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

- If every time we make a commit either small or containing more logical files, and if Git will push the
changes everytime we make a commit, then the number of commits will be very large. Since, no matter what 
how big or small commit is it will be automatically pushed. So, due to this, the changes should be done
manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 - If we create a repository either in git or GitHub, it will contain one master branch. Branch, known as 
 label also, is desrcibed as a series of commits, as the main parent.
 - Clone is a functionality to copy the repository from GitHub to the local computer.
 - Fork is a process of cloning one's repository to our account in GitHub only.

 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 If the copy of the remote state is not present locally, then if two users simultaneously
 edit the same file and commit those changes, the final commit will be stored in GitHub only
 not in one's personal computer and since the last state of remote is unknown then we cannot
 merge the remote and local commits.

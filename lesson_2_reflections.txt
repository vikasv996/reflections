How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the intermediate state btween the working directory and repository.
If we create a repo and there are files that we want to commit the, first the files are added to the
staging area i.e, any number of files we want to commit via git add <file_name>.
Then after that when we hit git commit, the files which are in the staging area, will be committed. For ex,
If there is one file -> one, if there is two files -> two. So, this is how the staging area works!

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

try to do so we'll get an error and we have to do manual merging.
